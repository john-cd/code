# Public API

To use the library in your code, add the crate to  your `Cargo.toml` as usual:

```bash
cargo add mdbook-utils
```

and peruse its [documentation](https://docs.rs/mdbook-utils/latest/mdbook_utils/).

Note that `cargo` changes the dash into an underscore, thus insert `use mdbook_utils::*;` or similar into your code.
